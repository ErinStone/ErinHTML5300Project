      This is the home page for the site. I would replace it with real content but right now I am just figuring out how heroku and git work together.

    <h3>4/29/2015</h3>
    <p> Since the work for this class is fairly open-ended, and my interest lies less in static websites and more in creating web-applications and using 3rd party APIs, I decided to create a site which will be a collection of small projects. Each project will be linked from this main page. My intention is rather basic in that I want to have a reference site to come back to at some later point when I might need to revisit the topics of the class.</p>
    
    <h4>4/30/2015 - <a href="amiright.html">Am I Right Calculator</a></h4>
    <p>The first project is a twist on the basic calculator built using javascript. However, unlike most standard calculators this one doesn't provide you the answer. Lets say you have 3 numbers to add together: 651 + 345 + 55. In a standard calculator you input them and the calculator provides the answer. That's great if you already know how to add, but what if you are learning how to add? Lets say you "do the math" and come up with 1041. How do you know it's right? If you are my 10 yr old, you pop the numbers into the iPad calculator and it tells you the answer is 1051. Great - so now you have the right answer but maybe not an understanding of where you went wrong. This twisted calculator will instead, allow you to enter the addends, and then allow you a spot to enter your answer. If they match you are correct! If the don't match it will tell you which digits in your answer match the digits in the real answer. This give you the opportunity to fix your math mistake on your own. 
    </p>
    <p>I am hoping to use a combination of html5 forms, and css to create a modern layout/design and then of course javascript to do the actual calculations. </p>
